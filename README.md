Assignment 1

Dataset: Loan data set for credit risk analysis
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rameshmehta/credit-risk-analysis)
This data set has different types of features such as categorical, numeric & date. The target variable is the default
(index). In financing, a default can occur when a borrower is unable to make timely payments, misses
payments, avoids or stops making payments. An explanation of the features in the appendix of this document.
Objective

The objective of this task is to develop an end-to-end data mining project by using the Python machine learning
library Scikit-Learn. Only the Scikit-Learn library can be used in this task. However, all non-ML libraries
(e.g., SciPy) are allowed.

Requirements
1. This is a classification problem.
2. Use 80% data for training and 20% for testing. Stratified sampling must be used.
3. Main steps of the project should be (a) “discover and visualise the data”, (b) “prepare the data for
machine learning algorithms”, (c) “select and train models”, (d) “fine-tune the model” and (e)
“evaluate the outcomes”. You can structure the project in your own way. Some steps can be performed
more than once.
4. In the steps (c) and (d) above, you must work with at least three machine learning algorithms.
5. In step (b), define at least one new feature by using the User-Defined Transformer. This transformer
includes a parameter indicating whether use the new feature(s) or not. In step (d), fine-tuning step must
use this parameter (as a hyper parameter).
6. Explanation of each step together with the Python codes must be included.
7. A comparison of the models’ performance must be included.
